Do not use Swashbukle!
======================
Don't use this package! It's an illustration of a [typosquatting attack](https://snyk.io/blog/typosquatting-attacks/) against the popular [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) package manager. It's only intended use is as part of a workshop. Feel free to use it in other educational settings, but never use it for any of your production code.

If you're stumbling upon this package, you probably want to use one of these packages instead:
- [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/)
- [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Newtonsoft](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Newtonsoft/)
